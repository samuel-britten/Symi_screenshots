## Symi
Symi is a mathematics software I am actively developing with a focus on symbolic manipulation of expressions. The goal of the software is to help users to visualize and learn about math, and to be a tool for both students and professionals to solve whatever problems come their way.

Symi is a solo project that I began developing in January 2025, so it has a long way to go and is currently unreleased, but I hope to make it a versatile tool that has everything users need to work on their mathematics related projects, all in one place. A major source of inspiration for this project is a predicament I often find myself in: working hard to solve a problem, but struggling to visualize it, all while having 20 Wolfram Alpha tabs open that I try (and fail) to keep organized. Hopefully this is an experience that I, along with anyone else who may have this problem, won't have to experience much longer.

Below you'll find a few screenshots showcasing the UI and basic functionality of Symi.
